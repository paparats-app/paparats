# Decisions

Product and engineering decisions taken where the handoff was silent or where we diverged from it.
Newest last. Each entry: context → decision → consequence.

## D1 — Toolchain versions (M0)
Tauri 2.11, React 19.1, TypeScript 6.0, Vite 8, ESLint 10, Vitest 5, react-router 8, i18next 26,
Zustand 5, TanStack Query 5, lucide-react 1.x. tauri-specta and specta are pinned to the same
release candidate (`=2.0.0-rc.25`) because the RCs are not semver-compatible with each other.

## D2 — Package layout (M0)
The repository root is both the pnpm workspace and the Cargo workspace. The Tauri crate is named
`paparats-desktop` (lib `paparats_desktop_lib`); the bindings exporter is a second binary
(`export-bindings`) so `pnpm specta` does not need to start the app.

## D3 — Mock switch (M0)
`PAPARATS_MOCK=1` is read by Vite at dev/build time (`__PAPARATS_MOCK__`). The UI also falls back to
the mock services automatically when it is not running inside Tauri (plain browser, Vitest).

## D4 — Frameless window chrome (M0)
`decorations: false` with `shadow: true`, so Windows 11 still draws the native rounded corners and
1 px border. No community title-bar plugin is used yet, so the maximise button has no Snap Layouts
hover flyout (accepted loss, as allowed by STACK.md).
